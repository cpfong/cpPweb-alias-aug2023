test is [ (also man test)
root@www:/usr/local/www/apache24/data/cpfong/docs/shell # diff /bin/test /bin/[

[ is a shell builtin

This means that '[' is actually a program, just like ls and other programs, so it must be surrounded by spaces:
if [$foo = "bar" ] will not work;

test 100 -gt 99 && printf "100>99\n" || printf "less"

test -e filename
echo $?  --> 0 for exists (ok, no error), and 1 for does NOT exist (fail)

test 
-e FILE 	FILE exists
-s FILE 	FILE exists and has a size greater than zero
-n FILE		FILE nonzero length

if [ $var -eq 5 ]; then
 printf "var is 5"
fi

test $var -eq 5 && printf "var is 5" || printf "not equal"
